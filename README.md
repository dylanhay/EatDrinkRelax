# Eat Drink Relax
Project 1

## Purpose
A website where one can randomize what they want to eat for dinner, drink on the side, and watch a movie to relax with. Each section allows for the user to randomly
generate until they find something they like. If the user REALLY likes what they have chosen, they can even add it to their favorites, and view them on a seperate page.
